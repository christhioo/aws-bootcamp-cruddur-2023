After creating the account, Console sign-in details will be displayed.

I copied the console password and used the console sign-in URL to login as new user.
Once I login with the temporary password, I updated with new password by using auto-generated password from https://passwordsgenerator.net/


As Account ID is difficult to remember, I login as root user to create my account alias
